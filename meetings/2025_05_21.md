### Testing on Théo's code (ghost-theory)

Signature is large but simple: ~30 constructors

Generation of lemmas -> done
Simplification tactic -> done

reification/evaluation: Trocq?

### New proof for the soundness of simplification (on level 2)

Reduction system on level two expressions:
  t =e=> t' 
  s =s=> s'
E.g
1. E_subst (t . s) (E_var 0) =e=> t
2. E_var 0 . sshift =s=> sid

Soundness of the reduction system
  t =e=> t' -> forall env, eval env t = eval env t'


Simplification implements the reduction system
  t =e=> simp t

Simplification yields irreducible terms
  irreducible (simp t)

I could try to prove (local) confluence (but looks like it won't help for completeness) -> this has not been proven elsewhere


Extract everything into substitutions
1. Q_succ i =q=> Q_rapply rshift i
2. E_var (Q_rapply r i) =e=> E_ren r (E_tvar i)
3. E_ren r t =e=> E_subst (S_ren r) t


### Cleanup functions (on level 2)

Simplified terms are not great to work with, e.g.
  rename rshift (Var i)
gets simplified to 
  substitute (rscomp rshift Var) (Var i)
but naively I would expect
  Var (S i)
  

Fold back substitutions into renamings when possible, e.g.
  E_subst (E_var 0 . sid) t 
yields
  E_ren (0 . rid) t


and also
  Q_rapply rshift i
yields
  Q_succ i

### Completeness issues

Good news: I (almost) managed to include the reduction rules:
  E_var 0 . sshift =s=> sid
  (E_subst s (E_var 0)) . (sshift >> s) =s=> s


Bad news: this is still not complete, because of quoted natural numbers and explicit renamings. 
Already remarked in the autosubst 2 paper!

E.g:
1. forall env, eval env ?i[?i . r] = eval env ?i[0 . r]
2. forall env, eval env (?r 0)[?r 0 . rshift] =₁ eval env (?r 0) 

Can we handle this with more reduction rules?
Can we write a decision procedure?
  decide_eq_qnat i1 i2 : 
    { forall env, eval env i1 = eval env i2 } +
    { exists env, eval env i1 <> eval env i2 }
Is it worth it?

?i[q . r] =?= ?i[q' . r']

### Representing base types

For the reduction rule:
  (E_subst s (E_var 0)) . (sshift >> s) =s=> s
we need decidable equality on level 2 terms/substitions.
Harder than it seems!

Level 2 expressions can contain base types 
  expr := E_tvar (n : nat)
        | ...
        | E_abase (b : base_tag) (x : base_type b)
with
  base_tag := Bbool | Bnat | ...
  eval_base Bbool := bool
  eval_base Bnat := nat
  ...
problem
  [eval_base b] might not have a decidable equality!


Possible solution: use metavariables for base types
and index terms with a mapping [mvar_index -> base]
  
(** [n] is the number of base metavariables. *)
Inductive expr {n : nat} : kind -> (fin n -> base) -> Type
| ...
| E_abase (mvar : fin n) : arg (AT_base (mvar_base m))

env n := forall (m : fin n), eval_base (mvar_base m)

### Multisorted terms & substitutions

occurs_in : sort -> sort -> Prop
binds_in : sort -> sort -> Prop

subst s := nat -> term s
substitute {s} : (forall s', occurs_in s' s -> has_var s' -> subst s') -> term s -> term s
